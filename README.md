Proven is a collection of TypeScript data structures which follow a functional
programming paradigm:

- Pure functions.
- Immutability.
- Referential transparency.
- Recursion.

Due to lack of native support for higher-order functions and impact of currying
implementations on performance and source size, the choice to enable such
functionality is left to the consumer. Currying can be added with the use of
many libraries, such as [Ramda](https://ramdajs.com/docs/#curry).
